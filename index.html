<h1>A really bad telephone number selector form</h1>

<p>This is a project I tried to make back in the summer of 2019, but at the time I tried to do it client side in JavaScript and it would crash the browser whenever you tried to load it. My next plan was to attempt to generate it with Liquid, but that didn't work either - the compiler got to 10GB of RAM usage before giving up at the number 268435456 (I'm aware this isn't a valid number but I was testing it). Eventually I decided on a different solution, as inspired by <a href="https://libraryofbabel.info">The Library of Babel</a>.</p>
