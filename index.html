<h1>A really bad telephone number selector form</h1>

<p>This is a project I tried to make back in the summer of 2019. The original intention was to have a webpage with a list of every single phone number in a random order, and at the time I tried to do it client side in JavaScript, but it would crash the browser whenever you tried to load it.</p>
    
<p>My next plan was to attempt to generate it with Liquid, but that didn't work either - the compiler got to 10GB of RAM usage before giving up at the number 268435456 (I'm aware this isn't a valid number but I was testing it). Eventually I decided on a different solution, as inspired by <a href="https://libraryofbabel.info">The Library of Babel</a>, where not all of the numbers are displayed at once.</p>

<p>This site was inspired by <a href="https://reddit.com/r/baduibattles">r/baduibattles</a>, a subreddit where people show off their intentionally bad UIs. Since posting there, I have added the following features as suggested by people in the comments.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Randomised order</li>
    <small><a href="https://reddit.com/u/JaydeChromium/">u/JaydeChromium</a> and <a href="https://github.com/TheGooseLord">TheGooseLord</a> both suggested this, although I had actually already planned it. I also set the font to comic sans just to annoy people.</small>

    <li>Yellow font</li>

    <li>Enter your number again to verify</li>

</ul>
